# KK_HCameraLight  

This plugin allows you to lock the camera light in place during H.  
By default, the light follows the camera so if you turn your view, the light will turn as well. With this, you can lock the camera light in place for example at the characters front view, after turning around the characters back should be unlit.

You can find the light lock/unlock button in the default game Light UI menu.
